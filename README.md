# Distributed-system-project : `Kafki` 
Kafka distributed streaming platform clone 

## Project description 
The project clones the functionalities of Kafka 
+ Publish and subcribe to streams of records, similar to message queue
+ Store streams of records in a fault tolerant way 
+ Process streams of records 
+ APIs : Producer, Consumer, Streams, Connector
